## About This Project

This is my first assignment in the Foundations track.

The goal was to practice core HTML fundamentals — no CSS, no JavaScript — just structure, linking, and clean markup.

---

## What It Includes

- An `index.html` homepage  
- A `recipes/` folder with individual recipe pages  
- Proper HTML boilerplate in every file  
- Relative links between pages  
- Images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions  
- Deployed using GitHub Pages  

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── ulavacharu.html
│   └── vegbiryani.html
└── images/
```

## What I Focused On

Since this was HTML-only, I treated it as a constraint-based challenge:

- Writing semantic HTML  
- Keeping the structure clean and readable  
- Using meaningful `alt` text  
- Maintaining consistent layout across pages  
- Practicing good Git habits (commit early, push often)

## Reflection

This project is intentionally simple.  
It reflects where I am in my learning journey.

I struggled with keeping the markup neatly structured, but that process helped strengthen my understanding of document flow, hierarchy, and organization.
