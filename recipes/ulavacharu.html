     <h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Ulavacharu is a deeply traditional Andhra delicacy made from slow-simmered horse gram (ulavalu), celebrated for its earthy depth and natural richness. The lentils are patiently boiled until tender, then crushed and strained to extract a thick, velvety broth that forms the base of this rustic preparation. Tempered with mustard seeds, cumin, garlic, dried red chilies, and fresh curry leaves, the dish develops a bold, smoky aroma and a layered savory character that reflects authentic Telugu home cooking.</p>

<p>Often served with hot steamed rice and a dollop of ghee, Ulavacharu offers a nourishing, protein-rich experience that is both hearty and comforting. Its slightly tangy undertone, balanced with green chilies and tamarind, enhances its complexity while maintaining simplicity at its core. This recipe captures the heritage essence of Andhra cuisine while remaining approachable for a modern kitchen.</p>

<h2>How to Make Traditional Ulavacharu (Step by Step)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Cook the Horse Gram</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wash and soak <strong>1 cup horse gram</strong> for 6–8 hours or overnight.</li>
      <li>Pressure cook with 4–5 cups water for 6–7 whistles or until very soft.</li>
      <li>Reserve the cooking liquid and allow the lentils to cool slightly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Extract the Ulavacharu Base</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blend or mash the cooked horse gram until coarse.</li>
      <li>Strain through a sieve, pressing firmly to extract a thick, smooth liquid.</li>
      <li>Discard the coarse residue or repurpose it in chutney.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Prepare the Tamarind Infusion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add tamarind extract, slit green chilies, turmeric, and salt to the strained horse gram liquid.</li>
      <li>Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 10–15 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Prepare the Tempering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat oil or ghee in a small pan.</li>
      <li>Add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter.</li>
      <li>Add cumin seeds, crushed garlic, dried red chilies, curry leaves, and asafoetida.</li>
      <li>Sauté until aromatic and lightly golden.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Final Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pour the hot tempering directly over the simmering Ulavacharu.</li>
      <li>Let it boil for another 2–3 minutes to integrate flavors.</li>
      <li>Turn off heat and rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Chef’s Technical Notes for Best Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Long soaking improves texture and reduces cooking time.</li>
  <li>The consistency should be thick but pourable—adjust with reserved cooking water if needed.</li>
  <li>Slow simmering enhances depth and removes raw tamarind sharpness.</li>
  <li>Tempering must be added hot for optimal aroma infusion.</li>
</ul>
