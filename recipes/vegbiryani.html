     <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This Vegetable Biryani is a celebration of aromatic Basmati rice and a vibrant medley of farm-fresh vegetables, slow-cooked to perfection. Each grain of rice is infused with a signature blend of hand-ground spices—including green cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves—and layered with caramelized onions, fresh mint, and coriander. The result is a fragrant, multi-dimensional dish where the natural sweetness of the carrots and peas balances the deep, savory warmth of the masala, creating a "dum-cooked" experience that is both comforting and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>Presented in a traditional copper handi, this recipe bridges the gap between heritage cooking and modern kitchen convenience. The addition of creamy saffron-infused milk provides a rich, golden hue and a luxurious mouthfeel that elevates it beyond a standard stir-fry. Served alongside a cooling cucumber raita and a spicy salan, this biryani is designed to be the centerpiece of any dining table, offering a premium, restaurant-quality meal that is entirely plant-based.</p>

     <h2>How to Make the Perfect Veg Biryani (Step by Step)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Rice (Parboiling Technique)</h3>
             <ul><li>Rinse <strong>2 cups basmati rice</strong> under cold running water until the water runs clear. Soak for 30 minutes.</li> 
                 <li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add salt (the water should taste like seawater) and the whole spices: green cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaf.</li> 
                 <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water.</li> 
                 <li>Cook until the rice is <strong>70–80% done</strong> (the grain should break with slight resistance).</li> 
                 <li>Immediately drain and spread the rice on a tray to prevent overcooking. Set aside.</li> </ul></li> 
      
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Birista (Golden Fried Onions)</h3>
             <ul><li>Heat oil in a wide pan over medium heat.</li> 
                 <li>Add half of the thinly sliced onions.</li> 
                 <li>Fry, stirring frequently, until they turn deep golden brown and crisp.</li> 
                 <li>Remove and drain on paper towels. They will crisp further as they cool.</li> </ul></li> 
       
        <li><h3>Cook the Vegetable Masala</h3>
             <ul><li>In the same pan, heat 3 tbsp oil or ghee.</li> 
                 <li>Add the remaining sliced onions and sauté until soft and lightly golden.</li> 
                 <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Cook until the raw aroma disappears.</li> 
                 <li>Add turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder, and biryani masala. Stir briefly to bloom the spices.</li> 
                 <li>Add mixed vegetables and sauté for 3–4 minutes.</li> 
                 <li>Lower the heat and add whisked yogurt. Cook until the oil begins to separate and the vegetables are 80% tender.</li> </ul></li> 
       
        <li> 
            <h3>Layering the Biryani (Dum Assembly)</h3>
             <ul><li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or handi, spread half of the vegetable masala evenly.</li> 
                 <li>Layer half of the parboiled rice over the masala.</li> 
                 <li>Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, coriander, nuts (if using), and drizzle saffron milk.</li> 
                 <li>Repeat the layers with remaining masala and rice.</li>
                 <li>Finish with ghee drizzle and optional rose/kewra water.</li> </ul></li> 
       
        <li>
            <h3>Dum Cooking (Steam Sealing Method)</h3>
             <ul><li>Seal the pot with a tight lid. For an authentic dum effect, seal the edges with dough.</li> 
                 <li>Cook on very low heat for 20–25 minutes. You may place a tawa (griddle) underneath to prevent burning.</li>
                 <li>Turn off heat and let it rest (covered) for 10 minutes.</li> </ul></li>
       
        <li>
            <h3>Final Touch & Serving</h3>
             <ul><li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, lifting from the sides to maintain layered structure.</li> 
                 <li>Serve hot in a traditional handi.</li>
                 <li>Pair with cucumber raita and mirchi ka salan for a complete meal.</li> </ul> </li></ol>
    <h2>Chef’s Technical Notes for Best Results</h2> 
             <ul><li>Do not overcook rice during boiling—this is the most common mistake.</li>
                 <li>Use aged basmati for longer, separate grains.</li> 
                 <li>Low, controlled heat during dum cooking ensures even steam circulation.</li>
                 <li>Resting time is critical for flavor harmonization.</li> </ul>
